# CODING:

**All the code except documentation must be in English**

## VARIABLES:
Local variables, instance variables, and class variables are also written in **lowerCamelCase**.

Variable names should be short yet meaningful. The choice of a variable name should be mnemonic — that is, designed to indicate to the casual observer the intent of its use. One-character variable names should be avoided except for temporary "throwaway" variables. Common names for temporary variables are i, j, k, m, and n for integers; c, d, and e for characters.

Example:
- myCar
- mcQueen
- user
- i


## CONSTANTS:
Constants should be written in **uppercase** characters separated by **underscores**. Constant names may also contain digits if appropriate, but not as the first character.

Example:
- MAX_PARTICIPANTS
- PATH

## METHODS:
should be verbs in **lowerCamelCase**.

Example:
- doAlgorithm()
- countWinsOfMcQueen()

## CLASSES:
Class names should be nouns in **UpperCamelCase**, with the first letter of every word capitalised. Use whole words – avoid acronyms and abbreviations (unless the abbreviation is much more widely used than the long form, such as URL or HTML).

Example:
- UserFactory
- Car
